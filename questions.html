<h1>Great Questions</h1>
<p>An exercise on Great Questions by Sigil Wen on Nov 25th, 2022</p>

<p>"That's what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting. People who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's compellingly mysterious." - Paul Graham</p>
<ul>
  <li>Henry Ford: Why do cars have to be luxury items?</li>
  <li>Alexandr Wang: How can machine learning models be easier to train?</li>
  <li>Sergei Brin: Why is it so hard to organize and access the world's information?</li>
  <li>Naval Ravikant: Why does startups and fundrasing have to be a black box?</li>
  <li>Richard Hamming: ‚Äúif a machine can find out that there is an error, why can't it locate where it is and
    change the setting of the relay from one to zero or zero to one?"</li>
  <li>Tapa Ghosh: How can we accelerate AI development? Why can't moores law be faster?</li>
  <li>Brian Armstrong: How can crypto be easier to use?</li>
  <li>Sam Altman: how can we ensure AGI benefits humanity?</li>
  <li>Patrick Collison: how can payments through the internet be easier?</li>
  <li>Peter Thiel: how can sending money through the internet be easier?</li>
  <li>Satoshi Nakamoto: can we create a payment system free from central control?</li> 
  <li>Vitalik Buterin: can we create a global computer free from central control?</li>
  <li>Jeff Bezos: how can we sell books online?</li>
  <li>Elon Musk: how can humans become an interplanetary species? How can we move from gas to electric based transportation? </li>
  <li>Steve Jobs: how can we make a computer that was user friendly?</li>
</ul>

<p>I actively think about how we can create tools to connect with each other that are aligned with our goals, instead of mining our attention for ad revenue. I'm optimistic. Let's see how this updates.</p>

<p>Inspired by Paul Graham's <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hs.html" target="_blank">What You'll Wish You'd Know</a> and Richard Hamming. If you have any more great examples of great questions, feel free to send them to me. I'm 0xSigil on twitter</p>
