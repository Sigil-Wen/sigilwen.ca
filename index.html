<h1>Sigil Wen</h1> 
<p>I'm currently helping the top O.1% extraordinary talent come to america on the O-1 Visa through <a href="https://extraordinary.club" target="_blank">extraordinary.club</a>. It's imperative that America attracts and retains the best worldwide talent to ensure its economic and technological dominance.</p> 
<p>I opted out of M&T @ UPenn to build in silicon valley on an <a href="https://youtu.be/1pu_j2V0GJs?si=oNjE3-c9UWGttGoy" target="_blank">O-1 Visa</a>.</p> 
<p>I actively Angel Invest ($25k-$100k) in exceptional technology founders through <a href="https://spearhead.co/" target="_blank">Spearhead</a>, training under Naval Ravikant.</p> 
<p>In pursuit of <a href="https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html" target="_blank">Great Work</a> while learning how to <a href="https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html" target="_blank">Work Hard</a> and <a href="https://jameslin.bio/focus/" target="_blank">Focus</a>.</p>

<h2>Past Endeavours</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1660406933680168960" target="_blank">Launched Airchat with Naval</a>. Built the viral invite loop and AI products. Recruited most of the engineering team. Acquired. </li>
  <li>Built Serendipity PRM (2,000+ MRR in 14 days). Was invited to Stripe, <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1560675678151852033?s=20">interviewed with Patrick & John Collison</a> where I become the :blistering-intensity: emote in the Stripe Slack among other memes. Naval told me Serendipity was not venture scalable, and my talent's were best used elsewhere so I joined Airchat.</li>
  <li>Built and failed to launch Monument. I thought more people could crowdfund their ambitions through crypto. Once I realized it was not viable (Sorry SEC), I pivoted to Serendipity. Backed by Naval Ravikant, Elad Gil, Justin Kan, Founders Inc. and other incredible supporters ‚ù§Ô∏è
  <li>Built Bitswap in hs, a bridge from decentralized social blockchain to Ethereum - couple million in volume. Feat. New Yorker, New York Magazine, Business Insider, etc. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnnDIcFdT6Y">Dharmesh publicly offered me $100k for 1% of bitswap</a> I <a href="https://youtu.be/ikUWZQAMr9k">shut it down</a> after the blockchain died</li>
