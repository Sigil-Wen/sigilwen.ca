<h1>Sigil Wen</h1> 
<p>I believe the most capable individuals will be able to execute 1000x faster than before, outpacing entire companies as they unlock massive amounts of leverage with AI.</p>
<p>My goal is mastery in this new age of infinite leverage and to create <a href="https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html" target="_blank">Great Work</a>. If you truly love yourself, I believe you are capable of making a significant positive dent on the universe.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I’m a self taught engineer, <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250522267532/en/Thiel-Foundation-Announces-2025-Class-of-Thiel-Fellows">2025 Thiel Fellow</a>, Magnificent Fellow, M&T @ UPenn opt-out, and hold the O-1 Visa for extraordinary ability. I started extraordinary.com to help the world’s best talent come to America. We power companies like Ramp, Cognition, Lovable, Zapier, Founders Fund, A16z, Khosla Ventures, and top technology companies across AI, crypto, deep tech, biotech, robotics, consumer. I think the most important thing to help American prosperity is bring in power law geniuses to push the forefront of technology.</p>
<p>I'm interested in crypto, distributed systems, AI, economics, incentives, and enjoy reading and programming. I try to think for myself, which I feel I only just started to do. I love working hard.</p>
