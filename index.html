<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I’m a self taught engineer, <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250522267532/en/Thiel-Foundation-Announces-2025-Class-of-Thiel-Fellows">2025 Thiel Fellow</a>, Magnificent Fellow, M&T @ UPenn opt-out, and hold the O-1 Visa for extraordinary ability.

We power companies like Ramp, Cognition, Lovable, Zapier, Founders Fund, A16z, Khosla Ventures, and top technology companies across AI, crypto, deep tech, biotech, robotics, consumer. I think the most important thing to help American prosperity is bring in power law geniuses to push the forefront of technology.</p>
