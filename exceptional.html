<h1>Exceptional</h1>
<a>Thoughts on how to be exceptional by Sigil Wen on Oct 2nd, 2022</a>
<ul>
  <li>Understand Mimetic Desire- avoid echochamber environments and groupthink. Burst your bubble</li>
  <li>Learn to think Independently. Independent thought comes from first principles thinking, independent reflection, curiosity, and an intentional information diet</li>
  <li>Incredible minds have incredible infromation diets. Protect your mind (against TikTok, Instagram, Media, YouTube, etc.)</li>
  <li>Everything falls under power law distributions. Being first often rewards 10000X more than being second. Everyone knows Usain Bolt, not the "Second fastest man in the world" </li>
  <li>Once you figure out what is the right thing to work on, pursue it with determination and blistering intensity.</li>
  <li>Diversifying focus is a hedge against your own success.</li>
  <li>"Exceptional people are built in solitude" - Naval Ravikant</li>
  <li>Don't conflate schooling with an education. The fact that many people can pass a course implies classes are desinged for the lowest common denominator. Break free through directed learning supplied with smart people who can answer your questions. These very well might be the students who've taken the course</li>
  <li>Serendipity (1/2): In an era where you can reach anyone you want over email, what matters most isn't your first impression. It's if you keep showing up, consistently, better than before. That's how you catch the eyes of the most exceptional people.</li>
  <li>Serendipity (2/2): Authentically update important people when you have made meaningful progress (Proof of Work). An email, text, or twitter DM increases the likelyhood that they think about you by a couple standard deviations.</li>
  <li>Everyone is human. Peer Relationships > Heirchal Pedastalling</li>
