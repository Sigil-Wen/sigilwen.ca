<h2>Reading Log</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Animal Farm by George Orwell
    <ul>
      <li>June 27th, 2023 Picked up at SFO Airport, Reminded me of the dynamics that emerge in a 30 person hacker house in SF when leaders get a taste of power. I'm not doing hacker houses anymore :,)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Martian by Andy Weir
    <ul>
      <li>May 18th, 2023 - Watney you son of a bitch. You did it against all odds. I love Weir - incredibly scientific and nerdy, all physically possible which is a delight to all nerds. I watched the movie afterwards and it was not as good hehe. Manga > Anime</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer
    <ul>
      <li>February 2nd, 2023 - the first "spiritual" book that made sense. No abstract jargon. Suffering stems from a strong sense of self and attachment. Enlightement is when you can go through life without being attached to anything or event. Let go <3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   <li>Man's Search for meaning by Victor E. Frankl
    <ul>
      <li>January 28th, 2023 - Suffering can be meaning with a paradigm shift.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill ðŸ˜¼
    <ul>
      <li>June 12th - 15th, 2022 - My mom gave me this book when I was 8 years old to read and summarize by chapter. Hill writes and reiterates that you cannot tap into the secrets of the book until you are ready to recieve them. BS amirite? At the time I coudn't grasp any concepts beyond the idea that if you Desire something hard enough it will transmute itself into reality. I couldn't understand it at the time but the concept embedded itself into the tapestry of my psyche. </li>
      <li>This time around, I got it. Crystal Clear. Desire is important as it sets you up to be ready to take advantages of the opportunities ahead of you. Mindset is everything and this book is for programming your mind :) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
