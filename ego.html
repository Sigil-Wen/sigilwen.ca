<p>"It's the Honest Introspection part that everyone falls down on. Because no one wants to admit they were wrong. Especially to themselves"</p>

<p><b>Sharing for Validation vs. Valuable Sharing</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Social Media Leverage can easily be derailed to negative compounding - Status optimization, productivity signalling. </li>
  <li>Core purpose of Media: Distribution for Authenticity. Share for Value not Status</li>
  <li>Status and Productivity Signalling are Short term- the types of people who look up to / are attracted by Status Signalling aren't the people you want to be with long term. <b>You attract the wrong people</b></li>
  <li>Perceptive long term people see through signalling, it turns people off. People already know you work with X person, so you don't need to constantly signal that.</li>
  <li>Long term posting is Substance > Status. </li>
  <li>Treat your audience as if it's the Smartest / most legit demographic you know. Attract the people you want to be around.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Taking Feedback: Optics vs. Optimization</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you care about becoming as good as you can be as fast as you can be, consider that people may have perspective that will push you ahead in your goals</li>
  <li>Accept the Optics of Submission - Lean into it - to grow the most. Ego creates resistance to accepting subordination from someone perceived at the "same level" or "below" you in Status.</li>
  <li>Feedback/Advice is Cheat Codes handed to you on a Silver Platter. </li>
  <li>Submit to the Student-Teacher relationship. Don't feel embarrassed. Assume by default they may be right, that you don't understand something, and extract the value.</li>
  <li>To receive feedback well, you need the other person to: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Feel completely comfortable giving you feedback</li>
    <li>Doesn't change/harms the relationship with you. In fact, it improves the relationship</li>
    <li>If you are sincerely receptive to it, and genuine appreciative, it makes them feel heard and feel good -> They feel happy having helped you, and a part of your journey</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Finite vs. Infinite Relationships</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Finite: It's natural to feel competition when your sense of identity comes from Status Supremacy in the Hierarchy</li>
  <ul>
    <li>What this manifests: For most people, helping them feels non threatening (of status), but for people slightly above or below in status, your perceived status is threatened, leading to finite behaviour. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Finite: feeling good from superiority over others. This is challengeable and triggers other people.</li>
  <li>Infinite: Realizing that <b>success is not a Selection Game</b> (Zero Sum), rather the <b>Barriers to success are Individual</b>: Intentional effort, Direction, and Execution.</li>
  <li>Infinite: Deriving Identity from Status & Supremacy -> Becoming the best version of yourself</li>
  <li>Infinite: Conspiring for Success: you can rise alongside your peer group and pull each other up. It's not you vs. the world. It's your peers (conspiracy) vs. the world. </li>
  <li>Infinite: That the game is Positive sum and the more people around succeed, the more prosperous you and the world is. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Art of Advice</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Helping others should not come from Ego, trading goodwill, or a feeling of Superiority. These are impure desires that make it feel transactional. Even if you are helpful, others will sense this and make them resent you.</li>
  <li>It matters what someone feels when & after you help them. </li>
  <li>The right type of Giving: Genuinely Acknowledge the network effects of helping others. The infinite games to be played.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Becoming a better Man: Friend, Citizen, Colleague, Human</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Be Earnest: Treat every interaction seriously, especially the first. If you don't like the "What do you do question", don't dismiss it or Troll the other person.</li>
  <lI><b>Have filter (empathy v.s superiority) but be less filtered (authenticity vs. image)</b></lI>
  <li>Everyone wants to be feel good about being asked to do something. </li>
  <li>Important people are pitched constantly. Be cognicsent </li>
  <li>Think more, do less, but do it fully. </li>
  <li>Follow through ;-)</li>
</ul>
